        <h4>Singing and Acting</h4>
        <p>Selena Marie Gomez (born July 22, 1992) is an American singer, actress, and producer. Born and raised in
            Texas, Gomez began her acting career on the children's television series Barney & Friends (2002–2004). In
            her teenage years, she rose to prominence for her lead role as Alex Russo in the Disney Channel television
            series Wizards of Waverly Place (2007–2012).</p>

        <h4>My Musical Style</h4>
        <p>Gomez is described as a pop artist with a mezzo-soprano vocal range. Her work is primarily characterised as
            dance-pop and EDM; however, she has experimented with different music genres. Her debut album with the Scene
            was influenced by electronic rock and pop rock,while her subsequent records with the band opted for a
            dance-pop sound.</p>

        <h2>Philanthropy</h2>
        <h4>My achievements regards UNICEF</h4>
        <p>In October 2008, Gomez participated in St. Jude's Children's Hospital's "Runway For Life" benefit. That same
            month, Gomez was named UNICEF's spokesperson for the Trick-or-Treat for UNICEF campaign, which encouraged
            children to raise money on Halloween to help children around the world. In August 2009, Gomez, then 17 years
            old, became the youngest UNICEF ambassador (Millie Bobby Brown later surpassed this record).</p><br>
